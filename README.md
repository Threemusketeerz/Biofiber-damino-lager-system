# Storage-system

This is more or less a blueprint of a storage system, developed in PHP, JavaScript and HTML. 
This is but one way to do it, and probably not the most effecient, but it works, and will get better and better as time flows.
If you wanna apply some code to your own storage system hopefully the comments on the code will help you.
